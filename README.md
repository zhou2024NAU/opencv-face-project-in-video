# opencv-face-project-in-video
this project uses python numpy and opencv to detect frame in the video and  rectangle the face
but I am not skillful using this website because I don't know how to use git,
so I only upload 1/12 of my whole project in the folder,that is the PythonApplication.py
I use the absolute path so you need to make a little change before using it
